## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. 🔧 Setup

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install python-telegram-bot
```

### 2. 🤖 Configure Your Bot

## 👥 How to Play
IMPORTANT: Group should be created and bot should be added as an admin.
1. A player starts the game with `/startgame`
2. Others join via **Join button**
3. After 40 seconds, the game auto-starts if 5+ players
4. Roles are assigned privately
5. Mafia, Doctor, Detective take **night actions**
6. Daytime voting begins (private voting)
7. Players are eliminated, and game continues until:
   - All Mafia are eliminated — Town wins 🎉
   - Mafia outnumber Town — Mafia wins 🔪

- ✅ Polymorphism (`night_action` methods)
- ✅ Abstraction (Abstract base classes)
- ✅ Encapsulation (player states)
- ✅ Modular structure with multiple classes/files

---

## 🧠 Authors

- 🔸 Developed by [Inha Students (ISE)]

---

## 📥 Data & Privacy

- All game data is ephemeral and saved only locally to `game_data.json`.
- Bot requires **admin rights** to manage messages properly in groups.
